A website to track tech vents in and adjacent to Roanoke Virginia. Can you help?

In [2010](https://twitter.com/artlung/status/12178230668693505) I created a website to track tech events in Roanoke Virginia. I put it at [t.noke.us](http://t.noke.us/).

I loved the idea, but I moved away in 2011. It's rather harder to keep up with it now that I've moved away. Are you interested in keeping it up to date? Please feel free to make a pull request and I can push changes to the site. Happy to add credits and links back to whomever wants to give back to the Roanoke (and adjacent!) tech communty. You can see I have things down in the Triangle and Charlottesville listed as well.

Questions? Add an issue here, or tweet me at [@artlung](https://twitter.com/artlung) or email me at joe@artlung.com or use the feedback form on my [website](http://artlung.com/contact/).
